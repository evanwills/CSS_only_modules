Is a system of ‘open abstraction’ the opposite and what might that look like in a programmable robotics project? Part of the challenge of teaching code is that so much needs to be learnt before a student can achieve a useful self-directed outcome. The idea for coding projects often lie outside the knowledge and skill set of learner programmers and developers. This is particularly true of younger students (age 5 to 10). In answer to this conundrum many programs build elaborate systems of closed abstraction – these might be described as ‘learning environments’ in which developers build ‘sandbox’ environments that use pseudo-code as a means of teaching programming concepts. Is it possible to build an alternative system of open-abstraction that allows students to immediately explore the potential of code and procedural instructions in interaction with the real world but which is open and extensible – indeed which encourages autonomous extension, adaptation and development that extends the platform itself.</p>
